# Sorting algorithms
Implementations of sorting algorithms with different asymptotic behaviours

OVERVIEW: <br>
<br>This program contains implementations of insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort, merge sort, and (LSB) radix sort. 
<br>Driver creates a random array of a specified length and range and instatiates each of the sort classes. The sort() methods for the different classes print 
the time taken to perform the sort. 
<br>The length of the array to sort, and the range of values on this array are easily modified to observe the performance of these sorts under different
 circumstances.

OBJECTIVES:
- To implement some of the algorithms discussed in class, and to observe the effects of design decisions.
- To witness the performance of these algorithms in different situations, and to develop intuition in choosing appropriate sorting algorithms for specific applications.
